## 📍 Overview

[![this product is ai free](https://this-product-is-ai-free.github.io/badge.svg)](https://this-product-is-ai-free.github.io)

This project, **subnetting**, is part of my journey to **revise Python (learned in 2019)** and keep my knowledge sharp by building a practical tool.

It focuses on **IP subnetting**: converting between CIDR, masks, binary, and decimal, while providing helpers for network administrators and students.
Think of it as both a **learning project** and a **utility tool**.</code>

---

## 👾 Features

- Convert between **CIDR notation** and **subnet masks**.
- Display **network address, broadcast address, and usable hosts**.
- Binary ↔ Decimal IP conversion helpers.
- Simple command-line usage to practice subnetting quickly.
- Designed as a **revision project** for Python basics (functions, modules, CLI, error handling).
